# Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository is intended to present a solution to final project of Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course.

## Description of the files:
1. run_analysis.R: a R function to solve the main project problem.
2. tidydata.txt: this is the output data set.
3. CodeBook.md: describes the data, variables, and transformations that performed to clean up the data.

## How-To:
1. Download the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from Coursera's course site. Or download from UCI Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.
2. Properly set the working directory.
3. Execute run_analysis function.
4. Note the output: a tidy data set called tidydata.txt.
5. For any doubts how the function run_analysis works, see CodeBook.md file.

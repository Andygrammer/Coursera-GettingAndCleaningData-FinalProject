# CodeBook: Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

## 1. About the data
- Merging the original training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## 2.About the variables
- subjectDataSet: "subject_train.txt" and "subject_test.txt" merged.
- xDataSet: "X_train.txt" and "X_test.txt" merged.
- yDataSet: "y_train.txt" and "y_test.txt" merged.
- xDataSet_measurements: the data containing only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- yDataSet: the data containing descriptive activity names to name the activities.
- completeDataSet: complete data with descriptive variable names.
- data_tidy: a second, independent tidy data set.
